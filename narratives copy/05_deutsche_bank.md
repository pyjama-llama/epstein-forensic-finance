## Summary

Deutsche Bank appears in more wire transfers in the master ledger than any other bank. I identified 38 wires totaling $56,792,936 (Unverified) where Deutsche Bank was either the sending or receiving institution. These wires touched every major entity in the Epstein financial network: Haze Trust, Southern Trust, Butterfly Trust, Southern Financial, Gratitude America, and personal intermediaries including Darren Indyke (Epstein's attorney).

Deutsche Bank's role in the Epstein relationship is already a matter of public record — the bank paid $150 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2020 to settle claims related to its Epstein accounts. This analysis does not replicate that regulatory finding. What it adds is a granular, wire-level map of where the money went after it left Deutsche Bank's books.

## Outflows by Recipient

| Recipient | Wires | Total (Unverified) |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Haze Trust | 8 | $31,287,087 |
| Southern Trust | 2 | $8,896,579 |
| Butterfly Trust | 4 | $6,350,000 |
| Darren Indyke | 5 | $5,798,525 |
| Gratitude America | 4 | $877,025 |
| Southern Financial | 2 | $309,101 |
| JPMorgan | 2 | $276,400 |
| Tazia Smith | 2 | $273,000 |
| Bank of America | 3 | $272,622 |
| BNY Mellon | 1 | $170,031 |
| Jeffrey (personal) | 1 | $140,400 |
| Citibank | 1 | $100,000 |
| Shuliak | 2 | $42,166 |

**Total outflows: $54,792,936 (Unverified) across 37 wires**

One inflow: Southern Trust → Deutsche Bank, $2,000,000 (undated).

## Chronological Pattern

The dated wires span from October 2012 to February 2019:

**2012-2013 (early period):** Small transfers — $30K and $20K to Butterfly Trust, $20K to Shuliak, $200K to Gratitude America. Plus two large transfers to Indyke: $3M (Oct 2013) and $2M (Nov 2013).

**2014 (peak activity):** $698K and $525 to Indyke (May 2014), $100K to Indyke and $100K to Citibank (Nov 2014), $2.5M to Haze Trust (Jul 2014), $7.5K to Bank of America (Jan 2014).

**2016:** $500K to Gratitude America (Jul 2016).

**2018-2019 (late period — largest transfers):** The heaviest activity occurred in the final 6 months before Epstein's arrest. Between August 2018 and February 2019: $5M, $8M, $8M, $58K to Haze Trust. $6M, $6M, $7M, $2.7M also to Haze Trust. $8M to Southern Trust. $300K to Butterfly Trust.

**The late-period concentration is stark.** Over 75% of Deutsche Bank's outflow volume occurred in the last 6 months of the relationship.

## The Indyke Connection

Five wires totaling $5,798,525 (Unverified) went from Deutsche Bank to entities associated with Darren Indyke, Epstein's long-time attorney:

| Date | Amount (Unverified) |
|------|------|
| Oct 11, 2013 | $3,000,000 |
| Nov 13, 2013 | $2,000,000 |
| May 16, 2014 | $698,000 |
| Nov 17, 2014 | $100,000 |
| May 21, 2014 | $525 |

The $3M and $2M transfers are the largest non-trust disbursements from Deutsche Bank in the dataset. The $525 wire is notable only for its size — it is the smallest transfer in the entire master ledger that involves Deutsche Bank.

## Custodian vs. Conduit

A critical question in interpreting this data: was Deutsche Bank acting as a custodian (holding and transferring assets at the client's direction) or as a conduit (actively facilitating the movement of money through the shell network)?

The data alone cannot answer this question. What the data shows:

- Deutsche Bank accounts held assets for Haze Trust, Butterfly Trust, Southern Trust, Southern Financial, Jeepers Inc., and Epstein's personal accounts
- Transfers between these entities frequently moved through Deutsche Bank
- The bank's compliance function either approved or failed to flag these transfers
- The concentration of large transfers in 2018-2019 occurred while Epstein was under heightened scrutiny

The 2020 DFS settlement confirms regulatory findings that Deutsche Bank's compliance failures were substantive, not merely procedural.

## What I Cannot Determine

- **Whether Deutsche Bank personnel had knowledge of the ultimate purpose of these transfers.** Wire instructions typically contain limited beneficiary information.
- **What triggered the late-period surge.** The 2018-2019 concentration could reflect changed investment strategy, asset repositioning, or other factors not visible in the wire data.
- **Deutsche Bank's complete relationship with Epstein.** I am seeing wires that survived into the EFTA corpus. The bank's internal records, which would show the full scope of the relationship, are not part of the public release.
