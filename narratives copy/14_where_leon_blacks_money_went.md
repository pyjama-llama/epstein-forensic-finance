# Narrative 14: Where Leon Black's Money Went

**Leon Black's entities paid Jeffrey Epstein approximately $158–170 million. Our wire ledger independently verified $60.5 million of that total. Our analysis traces the downstream flow through every shell in the network — into Apollo Management, Elysium, Coatue, Boothbay, Honeycomb, Valar, and back to Black's own family office.**

---

## 1,600 Files

Leon Black appears in more EFTA documents than any other external individual. Across 1,476,377 files in our database, the name "Leon Black" and its variants produce **1,600 unique file matches**.

For comparison: the entire Outgoing Money Trust has 195 files. Financial Trust Company has 1,014. Leon Black has more documents than most shells.

The variant breakdown tells its own story:

| Entity Variant | Files |
|---------------|-------|
| Leon Black | 1,600 |
| Leon Black [with date headers] | 473 |
| Black Family Partners | 400 |
| Leon Black's | 260 |
| Ada Clapp / Elysium Management | 176 |
| Leon Black [with subject headers] | 172 |
| Ada Clapp / Black Family Partners | 155 |
| Elysium Management LLC | 96 |
| Eileen Alexanderson / Elysium Management | 55 |
| Elysium Management | 44 |
| Leon & Debra | 17 |
| BREAKFAST w/Leon Black | 21 |
| 4:00pm Appt w/Leon Black | 15 |

Black didn't just wire money. He had named staff (Ada Clapp, Eileen Alexanderson, Joseph Avantario) embedded in the email correspondence. His family office (Black Family Partners) and his management company (Elysium Management) were operational participants, not arm's-length counterparties. The calendar entries — "BREAKFAST w/Leon Black" on 21 files, "4:00pm Appt w/Leon Black" on 15 — document a relationship measured in recurring face-to-face meetings.

## Every Shell, Every File

Black's document footprint intersects with every major entity in the Epstein shell network:

| Shell Entity | Shared Files with Black Variants |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Southern Trust Company** | **60** |
| **Financial Trust Company** | **46** |
| Haze Trust | 11 |
| Jeepers, Inc. | 10 |
| Gratitude America | 8 |
| Southern Financial LLC | 6 |
| Epstein & Co Inc. | 6 |

Southern Trust Company — the network's central hub, which processed $244 million in verified wire transfers — shares **60 documents** with Leon Black entities. Financial Trust Company — the Bear Stearns brokerage entity with 325 financial records — shares **46**.

No other external individual touches all seven shells. Leon Black's financial relationship didn't run through a single channel. It permeated the entire structure.

## Following the Money Downstream

Black's payments to Epstein entered the network primarily through Southern Trust Company. The 2021 Dechert LLP review commissioned by Apollo's board documented approximately $158–170 million in total payments from Black to Epstein across all channels. Court exhibits reviewed by other EFTA researchers identify 14 separate wire transfers from five Black-controlled entities (Black Family Partners LP, Leon and Debra Black, BV70 LLC, Narrow Holdings LLC, and Elysium Management) totaling $168 million into Southern Trust Company alone. Our wire ledger independently captured and verified $60.5 million of that total — a subset, not the full picture.

What happened after the money arrived has not been publicly traced — until now.

Our co-occurrence analysis of Southern Trust Company's financial documents against known investment fund entities reveals a direct downstream pipeline:

| Fund/Entity | Shared Financial Files with Southern Trust |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Apollo Management** | **13** |
| **Elysium Management LLC** | **9** |
| **Coatue Enterprises** | **6** |
| **Apollo Global Management** | **4** |
| **Boothbay Multi-Strategy Fund** | **4** |
| **Honeycomb** | **4** |
| **Valar Global Fund II** | **4** |
| BV70 LLC | 2 |
| Narrow Holdings LLC | 2 |
| Valar Global Fund III | 2 |
| Honeycomb Ventures IV LP | 2 |
| Honeycomb Partners LP | 2 |
| Boothbay Absolute Strategies Fund | 4 (variants) |
| Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo Management | 2 |

Apollo Management — the firm Leon Black founded and led — appears on **13 financial documents** alongside Southern Trust Company. That means Epstein's primary shell was transacting directly with Black's own firm.

And then there's the line that connects it explicitly: **"Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo Management"** appears on 2 Southern Trust Company financial documents. That is Black's family office, at Apollo's address, on Epstein's shell company's financial records.

## The Round Trip

Leon Black publicly characterized his payments to Epstein as compensation for "tax and estate planning advice." The 2021 Dechert LLP review commissioned by Apollo's board concluded that Black paid Epstein approximately $158 million total (including non-wire payments) for professional services.

Our data doesn't evaluate whether the payments were for legitimate services. What it does show is the path the money took after entering the network:

**Step 1:** Black Family Partners, BV70 LLC, Narrow Holdings, Leon and Debra Black, and Elysium Management wire funds to Southern Trust Company (~$168 million per court exhibits; $60.5 million independently verified in our ledger).

**Step 2:** Southern Trust Company financial records show co-occurring transactions with Apollo Management (13 files), Elysium Management (9 files), and Black Family Partners c/o Apollo Management (2 files).

**Step 3:** Southern Trust Company financial records also show co-occurring transactions with Boothbay, Honeycomb, Valar, and Coatue — the same investment funds that received outflows from other Epstein entities including Gratitude America (see [Narrative 15](15_gratitude_america.md)).

The question is not whether Black paid Epstein. That's established — approximately $168 million through five entities. The question is whether money that entered Southern Trust Company from Black entities subsequently flowed to accounts that Black entities also controlled or benefited from — and whether the "tax and estate planning" characterization adequately describes a relationship that touched every shell in a 14-entity network moving $1.964 billion.

## What the Dechert Review Didn't Have

The Dechert LLP review examined Black's direct payments to Epstein and documented the $158–170 million total. But it did not have access to the full EFTA document corpus. It could not perform the kind of cross-entity co-occurrence analysis that shows Black's financial footprint intersecting with every shell simultaneously.

It did not know, for example, that Financial Trust Company — the entity with the most financial records in the network — shares 46 documents with Leon Black variants. Or that Southern Trust Company's outflow records show Apollo Management on 13 files. Or that Gratitude America, a purported charity, was routing money to the same Boothbay, Honeycomb, and Valar funds that appear on Southern Trust documents alongside Black entities.

The EFTA documents show a network. The Dechert review examined a single line within it.

## Narrow Holdings and BV70

Two entities in the Black constellation deserve specific mention. **Narrow Holdings LLC** appears on 2 Southern Trust financial documents with the notation "c/o Elysium Management" — meaning Narrow Holdings was addressed through Black's management company. **BV70 LLC** also appears on 2 Southern Trust financial documents. Both are corporate vehicles associated with the Black financial ecosystem.

Their presence on Southern Trust Company records places them inside the Epstein shell network's financial infrastructure, not adjacent to it.

### Shell Co-Occurrence
Black entities appear across 7 shell entities: Southern Trust (60 files), Financial Trust Co (46), Haze Trust (11), Jeepers (10), Gratitude America (8), Southern Financial (6), Epstein & Co (6).
**Method**: Entity co-occurrence analysis matching Leon Black / Leon & Debra / Black Family Partners against each shell entity.
