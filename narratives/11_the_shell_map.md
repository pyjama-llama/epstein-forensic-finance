# The Shell Map

**The wire ledger captured 7 entities. The corpus contains 14. Four of them — with 23,922 money references between them — never appeared in a single wire transfer.**

*This narrative marks a transition. Narratives 1–10 analyzed what Deutsche Bank produced under a single SDNY subpoena: 382 wire transfers totaling $1.964 billion. That analysis is complete. Starting here, the scope expands to the full EFTA corpus — 1.48 million documents, 11.4 million entities, 463,402 dollar-amount references, and 13,146 emails flowing through a single operational hub. The wire ledger was the map. This is the territory.*

*This analysis maps every shell entity in the Epstein financial network by searching the full EFTA corpus for corporate entities (trusts, LLCs, LPs, and incorporated entities) that co-occur with "Epstein" in the same documents. It then measures document co-occurrence between shells to map their internal connections. See [COMPLIANCE.md](../COMPLIANCE.md) for professional standards framework.*

## What the Wire Ledger Built

Narratives 1–6 mapped wire transfers through seven shell entities: Southern Trust Company, Southern Financial LLC, The Haze Trust, Gratitude America Ltd., Jeepers Inc., Plan D LLC, and BV70 LLC. These were the entities that appeared in the Deutsche Bank-SDNY wire production (Exhibits A–E). Together, they processed $1.964 billion in verified wires. Narrative 7 correlated those wires against flight records. Narratives 8–9 scanned the corpus for who bridges the financial and victim document universes. Narrative 10 tested the wire amounts against Benford's Law.

That body of work answered the question: *what did the wire transfers show?*

This narrative asks a different question: *what else is there?*

## Why Only Deutsche Bank

The wire ledger exists because Deutsche Bank was prosecuted. In 2020, the New York State Department of Financial Services fined Deutsche Bank $150 million for BSA/AML compliance failures on the Epstein accounts. The SDNY production (Exhibits A–E) contains wire transfer records that Deutsche Bank was required to produce as part of that enforcement action.

But Epstein did not bank exclusively with Deutsche Bank. The corpus documents financial activity across at least eight major banking institutions:

| Bank | Financial Files w/ Money | Money Mentions | Primary Shell Connections |
|------|------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Bear Stearns** | 191 | **2,381,211** | Financial Trust Co (66 files, 6,910 mentions) |
| **JPMorgan/Chase** | 615 | **744,536** | Outgoing Money Trust (14+), Financial Trust Co (10) |
| **Deutsche Bank** | 1,564 | **415,287** | All wire-ledger shells — source of Exhibits A–E |
| **Citibank** | 39 | **78,176** | Gratitude America wire entity names |
| **Goldman Sachs** | 25 | **14,999** | TBD |
| **HSBC** | 44 | **13,389** | Haze Trust (Bermuda wire) |
| **Morgan Stanley** | 82 | **13,255** | Gratitude America ($5.5M investment vehicle) |
| **Credit Suisse** | 8 | **419** | TBD |

Additional institutions with significant corpus presence: **Bank of Hawaii** (2,431 total files — USVI local banking), **Fifth Third Bank** (486 files, 289 financial), **Wells Fargo** (153 files — Outgoing Money Trust, 63 shared), **Bank of America** (150 files — Outgoing Money Trust, 38 shared), **TD Bank** (Outgoing Money Trust, 23 shared), **PNC Bank** (Outgoing Money Trust, 12 shared), **Sabadell United Bank** (Outgoing Money Trust, 11 shared).

Bear Stearns has **5.7 times** more money-entity mentions in financial documents than Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan/Chase has **1.8 times** more. Deutsche Bank ranks third. The wire ledger was built from the third-largest bank's enforcement production.

The shells that appear in hundreds of financial documents but zero wire transfers — Financial Trust Co (325 financial docs, primarily Bear Stearns), Epstein & Co (174 financial docs), Butterfly Trust (73 financial docs), Outgoing Money Trust (180 financial docs across seven banks) — were not inactive. They were banking elsewhere.

## What the Corpus Shows

I searched 11.4 million entity records for every corporate entity (Trust, LLC, Inc, LP, Ltd) that appears in financial documents alongside "Epstein." Then I measured how many documents each entity appears in, what types of documents they are, and which shells appear together in the same files.

The search returned 14 distinct entities. The wire ledger captured 7 of them. The other 7 have never been analyzed.

## The Complete Shell Network

| Entity | Total Files | Financial | Court | Email | Money Mentions | In Wire Ledger? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Financial Trust Co** | 1,014 | **325** | 88 | 163 | — | ❌ |
| **Southern Trust Company** | 883 | 178 | 12 | 248 | **78,569** | ✅ $244M |
| **Southern Financial LLC** | 628 | 118 | 18 | 215 | **57,208** | ✅ $139M |
| **Epstein & Co Inc** | 400 | 174 | 14 | 50 | **10,482** | ❌ |
| **Jeepers Inc.** | 270 | 19 | 24 | 50 | — | ✅ $58M |

| **Haze Trust** | 186 | 12 | 0 | 89 | **8,486** | ✅ $126M |
| **HBRK Associates** | 13,389 | 95 | 10 | **13,146** | — | ❌ |
| **Outgoing Money Trust** | 195 | **180** | 0 | 0 | **2,338** | ❌ |
| **Butterfly Trust** | 219 | 73 | 4 | 39 | **3,302** | ❌ |
| **Insurance Trust** | 71 | 49 | 0 | 4 | **7,800** | ❌ |
| **Epstein Interests Inc.** | 116 | 28 | 5 | 30 | — | ❌ |
| **Nautilus Inc.** | 149 | 13 | 21 | 37 | — | ❌ |
| **Plan D LLC** | 55 | 8 | 3 | 16 | — | ✅ $41M |

**Financial Trust Company** has more financial-document appearances (325) than Southern Trust (178) or Southern Financial (118). It has 88 court filings. It has 163 emails. And it does not appear in a single verified wire transfer.

**HBRK Associates** appears in 13,146 emails — more than every other shell entity combined. It has 95 financial document appearances. This is the correspondence hub through which operational communication flowed. HBRK Associates Inc. is listed as Jeffrey Epstein's business address across 1,766 total files.

**Outgoing Money Trust** appears in 180 financial documents and zero court filings, zero emails, zero letters. It exists only in financial records. Its name describes its function.

**Butterfly Trust** appears in 73 financial documents and contains 3,302 money-entity mentions. It has no wire transfer record.

**Insurance Trust** contains 7,800 money-entity mentions across 111 files — more money references per file than any other shell except Southern Trust.

## How They Connect: The Co-Occurrence Map

Two shell entities appearing in the same document indicates a relationship — a transfer, a shared statement, a legal filing that names both. The strength of that co-occurrence measures how tightly connected two shells are.

| Connection | Shared Files | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Southern Financial ↔ Southern Trust | **163** | Strongest bond in the network. Same bank statements, same transfers, same legal filings. |
| Epstein & Co ↔ Financial Trust Co | **126** | Brokerage cluster — these two entities operate as a unit in financial documents. |
| Financial Trust Co ↔ Jeepers | **125** | Financial Trust Co feeds the Jeepers brokerage pipeline. Previously unknown connection. |
| HBRK Associates ↔ Southern Trust | **111** | Operational hub communicates with the accumulation trust. |
| HBRK Associates ↔ Southern Financial | **104** | Same pattern — HBRK is the email interface for both trusts. |
| Financial Trust Co ↔ Southern Trust | **92** | Financial Trust Co connects to the main accumulation layer. |
| Financial Trust Co ↔ Southern Financial | **81** | And to the distribution layer. |
| Epstein & Co ↔ Southern Financial | **73** | Brokerage connects to distribution. |
| Butterfly Trust ↔ Southern Trust | **61** | Butterfly Trust connects to accumulation. |
| Butterfly Trust ↔ Southern Financial | **55** | And to distribution. |
| Gratitude America ↔ Southern Trust | **50** | Charity connects to the main trust. |
| Jeepers ↔ Southern Trust | **50** | Brokerage pipeline connects to accumulation. |
| Haze Trust ↔ Southern Trust | **49** | Art money connects to accumulation. |
| Haze Trust ↔ Southern Financial | **48** | And to distribution. |
| Butterfly Trust ↔ HBRK Associates | **37** | Butterfly Trust communicates through the email hub. |
| HBRK Associates ↔ Haze Trust | **32** | Art money communicates through the email hub. |
| Nautilus ↔ Southern Financial | **32** | Aircraft entity connects to distribution. |
| Butterfly Trust ↔ Haze Trust | **30** | Two trusts share 30 documents. |
| Epstein & Co ↔ Epstein Interests | **30** | Brokerage connects to holding company. |

## The Architecture

The co-occurrence map reveals a hub-and-spoke architecture, not a linear pipeline.

**Hub**: Southern Trust and Southern Financial are the center. Every other entity connects to at least one of them. They share 163 documents with each other — the strongest bond in the network. Together, they hold 78,569 + 57,208 = **135,777 money-entity mentions**.

**Brokerage Cluster**: Financial Trust Co, Epstein & Co, and Jeepers form a tightly connected sub-network (126 + 125 + 21 shared files between them). Financial Trust Co bridges this cluster to both Southern Trust (92) and Southern Financial (81). This is the trading and brokerage infrastructure.

**Communication Layer**: HBRK Associates connects to Southern Trust (111), Southern Financial (104), Butterfly Trust (37), Haze Trust (32), and Jeepers (24). It touches everything through email. This is the operational interface — instructions flow through HBRK.

**Trust Layer**: Butterfly Trust, Haze Trust, Insurance Trust, and Gratitude America each connect to the Southern Trust/Financial hub but have weaker connections to each other. These are purpose-specific vehicles: art (Haze), insurance (Insurance Trust), and undetermined (Butterfly).

**Operational Entities**: Nautilus (aircraft), Epstein Interests (holding company), and Plan D (Leon Black vehicle) sit at the periphery with fewer connections but specific functions.

## Beyond the Wire Production

The wire transfer ledger — 382 verified wires totaling $1.964 billion — represents what Deutsche Bank produced under a single SDNY subpoena. The shell network is larger than what that subpoena captured.

**Financial Trust Company** has 325 financial document appearances and zero wire transfers. Whatever moved through it — checks, ACH transfers, brokerage settlements, trust distributions — was not captured in the SDNY wire production. Yet it connects to Jeepers (125 shared files), Southern Trust (92), and Southern Financial (81). It is central to the financial infrastructure.

**Outgoing Money Trust** has 180 financial documents. Its name is its function. It has zero connections to the legal record (no court filings, no emails, no letters). It exists exclusively in the financial documentation.

**Insurance Trust** has 7,800 money-entity mentions across 111 files — an average of 70 dollar amounts per document. For comparison, Southern Trust averages 89 per file across its 883 total files. The Insurance Trust is processing money at comparable density but in a fraction of the documents.

**Butterfly Trust** has 3,302 money mentions across 150 files and connects to Southern Trust (61), Southern Financial (55), HBRK (37), and Haze Trust (30). It is integrated into the network but serves an undetermined purpose.

## The Scale

The wire ledger documented $1.964 billion through 7 of these 14 entities. The corpus contains **178,592 money-entity mentions** across all 14 shells. The four shells absent from the wire ledger — Epstein & Co, Insurance Trust, Butterfly Trust, and Outgoing Money Trust — account for **23,922 of those money mentions**.

We mapped the rivers. The corpus shows there are also streams, creeks, and underground channels. The financial network was not four entities and a wire ledger. It was fourteen entities, connected through 13,000+ emails, hundreds of financial documents, and money references that no single subpoena captured in full.

## What I Cannot Determine

- **The dollar volume flowing through untracked shells.** Money-entity mentions count the number of times a dollar amount appears near a shell name — not the total amount. A single bank statement with 50 line items generates 50 mentions. I cannot sum these without parsing each amount individually.
- **The function of Butterfly Trust, Outgoing Money Trust, or Insurance Trust.** Document summaries are largely empty for these entities. Their purpose must be determined from the source documents themselves.
- **Whether Financial Trust Co processed wire transfers through a different bank.** Its absence from the Deutsche Bank production may mean it banked elsewhere — not that it didn't move money.
- **The content of HBRK's 13,146 emails.** These are extracted entity mentions, not full email text. The operational instructions that flowed through HBRK are in the source files, not the entity database.
