## Summary

Plan D LLC disbursed $18,000,000 (Unverified) to Leon Black across 4 wire transfers between 2014 and 2017. In the same dataset, I found $1,125.03 flowing *into* Plan D LLC — a single remittance advice entry. The entity's inflow-to-outflow ratio is essentially zero. Plan D LLC paid out $18 million that, within the EFTA corpus, has no visible funding source.

Separately, Leon & Debra Black and Black Family Partners LP transferred $131,500,000 (Unverified) *into* Southern Trust Company Inc. — the central hub of the Epstein trust network — across 12 wire transfers documented on **Exhibit A**.

**Total Plan D → Leon Black: $18,000,000 (Unverified)**

**Total Plan D inflows found: $1,125.03**

## Black Family → Southern Trust

The larger financial relationship between Leon Black and the Epstein network is visible through **Exhibit A** of the Deutsche Bank-SDNY production. I identified 12 transfers from Black-affiliated entities into Southern Trust Company Inc.:

| Date | From | Amount (Unverified) | Source |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Oct 15, 2013 | Leon & Debra Black | $8,500,000 | Exhibit A |
| Dec 18, 2013 | Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo | $10,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Apr 25, 2014 | Leon & Debra Black | $5,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Apr 25, 2014 | Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo | $5,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Apr 29, 2014 | Leon & Debra Black | $15,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 16, 2014 | Leon & Debra Black | $7,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 16, 2014 | Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo | $13,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 22, 2014 | Leon & Debra Black c/o Apollo Mgmt | $2,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 22, 2014 | Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo | $3,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 13, 2015 | Leon & Debra Black c/o Apollo Mgmt | $5,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Oct 13, 2015 | Black Family Partners LP c/o Apollo | $5,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Dec 18, 2015 | Black Family Partners LP | $10,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Dec 30, 2015 | Leon & Debra Black c/o Apollo Mgmt | $10,000,000 | Exhibit A |
| Apr 25, 2017 | Leon & Debra Black c/o Apollo Mgmt | $8,000,000 | Exhibit A |

**Total Black-affiliated → Southern Trust: $106,500,000 (Unverified)**

Additional Black-related transfers through other channels bring the total visible Black-network activity to approximately $163 million (Unverified) across 34 ledger entries.

## The Two-Direction Pattern

The financial data shows money flowing in two directions simultaneously:

**Inbound to Epstein network**: $106.5M from Black-affiliated entities → Southern Trust Company (2013-2017)

**Outbound from Epstein network**: $18M from Plan D LLC → Leon Black (2014-2017)

The timing overlaps. On April 25, 2014, Leon & Debra Black sent $5M to Southern Trust (Exhibit A) while Plan D LLC sent $5M to Leon Black (Phase 25 recovery). On October 22, 2014, Black Family Partners sent $3M to Southern Trust (Exhibit A) while Plan D LLC sent $3M and $2M to Leon Black.

I present the data without interpreting the business purpose. The same-day matching of amounts in opposite directions is visible in the records.

## Additional Black-Network Activity

Beyond Plan D LLC and Southern Trust, I found transfers involving Debra Black through other channels:

- ALEXANDERSON → Debra Black: $5,000,000 (Apr 25, 2014)
- JPMorgan → Debra Black: $3,200,000 and $2,900,000 (undated)
- HANNAN → Debra Black: $1,770,000 (undated)
- Southern Trust → Debra Black: $8,500,000 (Oct 15, 2013)
- HALPERIN → Leon Black: $3,200,000 (undated)

## What I Cannot Determine

- **What Plan D LLC was.** I know its outflows. I do not know its corporate structure, registration, or stated purpose.
- **Where Plan D LLC's money came from.** The $18M it disbursed has no visible funding source within the EFTA corpus.
- **The business purpose of the Black → Southern Trust transfers.** These could be investment allocations, loan payments, advisory fees, or other arrangements.
- **The relationship between the inbound and outbound flows.** The same-day matching is a data observation, not a conclusion about intent.
