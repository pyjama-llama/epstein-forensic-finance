# 734,122 Names

**I asked the database who bridges the financial and victim document universes. It answered without being told who to look for.**

*This analysis queries every person entity in the EFTA corpus — 734,122 unique names extracted by NLP from 1.48 million documents — for co-occurrence across document categories. No names were pre-selected. The database determined who appears in both financial and victim-related records. See [COMPLIANCE.md](../docs/COMPLIANCE.md) for professional standards framework.*

## The Question

The EFTA corpus contains 11.4 million entity extractions across 1.48 million DOJ documents. Of those, 734,122 are unique person-type entities. Most appear in one category of document. A few appear in two. A very small number appear in three.

I ran one query: show me every person who appears in at least 3 financial documents AND at least 3 victim-related documents. No name list. No search terms. The database decided.

## The Query

```sql
SELECT name, financial_files, victim_files, flight_files
FROM entities × files
WHERE entity_type = 'PERSON'
GROUP BY name
HAVING financial_files >= 3 AND victim_files >= 3
ORDER BY financial_files + victim_files DESC
```

After filtering NLP noise (common nouns misclassified as persons, location names, legal citation fragments), the query returned **57 real names**.

Every one of them falls into one of four categories. The classification is the finding.

## Category 1: The Operational Core

These individuals managed Epstein's financial, travel, and household operations. They appear in financial documents because they moved money. They appear in victim documents because victims, prosecutors, and civil plaintiffs named them.

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Flight Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Ghislaine Maxwell** | 204 | 1,312 | 53 | Convicted on 5 federal charges including sex trafficking of a minor (2021) |
| **Darren K. Indyke** | 196 | 204 | 176 | Estate attorney; co-signed wire transfers; named defendant in USVI victim lawsuit (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf" target="_blank">EFTA00018778</a>) |
| **Lesley Groff** | 134 | 153 | 20 | Executive assistant; managed scheduling; appears alongside "Jane Doe" and "Victim Payouts" in same documents |
| **Richard Kahn** | 110 | 29 | 28 | Attorney; disbursed $9.3M through wire network; named defendant in USVI victim lawsuit |
| **Larry Visoski** | 99 | 76 | 249 | Primary pilot; named in depositions where victims described travel to Epstein properties |
| **Sarah Kellen** | 5 | 132 | 4 | Identified by victims as scheduler who arranged visits |
| **Alfredo Rodriguez** | 6 | 128 | 1 | Household staff; testified about what he witnessed; attempted to sell "black book" to FBI |
| **Jean-Luc Brunel** | 14 | 120 | 4 | MC2 modeling agency; named by victims; found dead in Paris jail, February 2022 |
| **Juan Alessi** | 0 | 61 | 2 | Household staff; testified about operations at El Brillo Way |
| **Nadia Marcinkova** | 0 | 35 | 0 | Named by victims in depositions and civil filings |

Maxwell is the only person in the corpus who occupies the center of all three document categories at scale. She was convicted. The database confirms what the jury found.

Indyke and Kahn are the financial managers. They signed wire transfers (Narrative 1–6), appeared on travel documents, and were named as defendants in a 55-page USVI victim lawsuit (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018778.pdf" target="_blank">EFTA00018778</a>) alongside Epstein — a court filing that references Little Saint James and uses Jane/John Doe plaintiff designations.

Groff is the scheduler. Documents in the corpus place her name in the same file as "Jane Doe" (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00446172.pdf" target="_blank">EFTA00446172</a>), "Victim Payouts" (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00371439.pdf" target="_blank">EFTA00371439</a>), and "the Federal Crime Victims Rights Act" (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00429909.pdf" target="_blank">EFTA00429909</a>). She managed the calendar.

## Category 2: Named Associates

These individuals are not operational staff but appear in both financial and victim-related documents due to their public association with Epstein. Their victim-document presence reflects civil lawsuits, media coverage within the corpus, and legal proceedings — not necessarily direct accusations.

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Flight Docs | Public Connection |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Alan Dershowitz** | 10 | 408 | 7 | Defense attorney; named in Virginia Giuffre civil suit |
| **Roy Black** | 28 | 250 | 3 | Defense attorney; also received $4.6M wire from Plan D LLC (Exhibit B) |
| **Prince Andrew** | 11 | 211 | 11 | Named in Virginia Giuffre civil suit; settled 2022 |
| **Bill Clinton** | 5 | 201 | 9 | Flight log presence; named in civil depositions |
| **Donald Trump** | 9 | 163 | 7 | Named in victim-related civil filings |
| **Leslie Wexner** | 5 | 70 | 3 | L Brands; financial relationship with Epstein |
| **Scott Rothstein** | 12 | 645 | 2 | Ran $1.2B Ponzi scheme; case intersected with Epstein through South Florida legal community |

**Roy Black** is a borderline case. He is Epstein's defense attorney — which explains his victim-document presence (250 filings). But he also received $4.6 million through the wire transfer network from Plan D LLC (Exhibit B, Narrative 3). He is both legal representation and wire recipient.

**Scott Rothstein** appears in 645 victim documents — more than Maxwell's 491 last-name-only count. His $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme case generated extensive South Florida court filings that cross-reference the Epstein investigation through shared jurisdiction, shared attorneys, and shared legal proceedings.

## Category 3: The Legal Ecosystem

The largest category. These are the attorneys, prosecutors, judges, law firms, and paralegals who worked the Epstein case on all sides. Their presence in both financial and victim documents reflects the legal process, not operational involvement.

**Victims' Attorneys:**

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Bradley J. Edwards | 9 | 948 | Lead victims' attorney; author of "Relentless" |
| Jack Scarola | 4 | 706 | Co-counsel for victims |
| Michael J. Pike | 5 | 350 | Victims' attorney; correspondence references "Jane Does Nos. 2 through 7" |
| Spencer Kuvin | — | — | Victims' attorney (Pike's firm) |

**Prosecution:**

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Lilly Ann Sanchez | 10 | 236 | Assistant United States Attorney; prosecuted the case |
| Bruce E. Reinhart | 4 | 177 | Magistrate Judge; signed search warrant |

**Defense Attorneys:**

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Jack Goldberger | 18 | 561 | Lead defense counsel |
| Marc S. Nurik | 3 | 562 | Defense attorney |
| Martin G. Weinberg | 52 | 217 | Defense attorney; 52 financial docs is notable |
| Fred Haddad | 3 | 277 | Palm Beach defense attorney; emails with Groff, Indyke, Goldberger |
| Jay P. Lefkowitz | 15 | 96 | Attorney |
| Robert Josefsberg | 3 | 162 | Attorney |
| Robert D. Critton | 8 | 495 | Attorney |

**Law Firms:**

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Podhurst Orseck | 18 | 96 | Victims' law firm |
| Fowler White Burnett | 33 | 225 | Defense law firm |
| Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin | 29 | — | V.I. estate counsel; received $23M in wire transfers |

**Other Legal:**

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Joseph L. Ackerman | 10 | 316 | Attorney; worked Epstein legal matters |
| Jackie Perczek | 21 | 115 | Paralegal or legal staff; court filings dating to 1981 |
| W. Chester Brewer | 6 | 135 | Attorney |
| Russell Adler | 3 | 116 | Attorney |
| Katherine W. Ezell | 10 | 110 | Podhurst Orseck attorney |
| Kara Berard Rockenbach | 4 | 98 | Attorney |
| Scott J. Link | 6 | 132 | Attorney |
| Christopher E. Knight | 11 | 106 | Attorney |

## Category 4: Financial Infrastructure

One name appeared that is not an attorney, associate, or operational staff member:

| Name | Financial Docs | Victim Docs | Role |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Eric Gany | 115 | 6 | Epstein's office shipping clerk — 115 "financial" docs are FedEx invoices billed to "ERIC GANY / JEFFREY E EPSTEIN / FINANCIAL TRUST COMPANY" at 457 Madison Ave, New York |

## What the Classification Reveals

Of 734,122 unique person entities in the EFTA corpus, exactly **57 real names** bridge both the financial and victim document universes at a threshold of 3+ documents each.

Of those 57:

- **10 are operational staff** — the people who ran the machine
- **7 are named associates** — public figures connected to Epstein
- **~25 are attorneys and legal professionals** — the people who litigated the case
- **~15 are name variants** of the above (OCR artifacts, first-name-only, last-name-only)
- **1 is a shipping clerk**

The legal ecosystem is the largest category because the Epstein case generated thousands of court filings over two decades. Attorneys on both sides appear repeatedly across document types. This is normal legal practice, not evidence of involvement.

The operational core is the smallest category — and the most significant. These are the people who did not enter the victim document universe through legal filings about the case. They entered it because they were named in the filings as participants. Maxwell (convicted), Indyke and Kahn (named defendants in USVI victim lawsuit), Groff (appears alongside victim references in operational documents), Kellen (identified by victims as scheduler), Rodriguez and Alessi (testified about what they witnessed).

## What I Did Not Find

- **No unknown operational staff.** Every person who bridges the financial and victim universes at scale is already publicly identified. The 734K scan did not reveal a hidden participant.
- **No financial entity executives.** No banker, fund manager, or investment professional appears in victim documents. The money sources and recipients documented in Narratives 1–7 are absent from the abuse record.
- **No victim names.** "Jane Doe" appears 1,303 times in financial-adjacent documents (primarily court filings with monetary components). No identified survivor's real name bridges both categories.

The EFTA corpus, searched exhaustively and without prejudice, returns a network that is already known. What is new is the scale of documentation — the number of documents in which each person appears — and the confirmation that the operational core is exactly as small and as identified as prior investigations concluded. No one is hiding in 1.48 million files who hasn't already been found.
