# Data Narratives

**The financial data tells stories that numbers alone cannot convey.**

These narratives trace fund flow patterns, entity relationships, temporal correlations, and forensic accounting anomalies identified across the 1.48 million documents in the DOJ EFTA release. Early narratives are grounded in wire-level data from the [master wire ledger](../data/master_wire_ledger_phase25.json). Later narratives draw on the full corpus: 11.4 million entity extractions, 734,122 unique persons, 2.4 million dates, and 321 aircraft flight records. Each finding is extracted through the [25-phase pipeline](../docs/METHODOLOGY.md) and cross-referenced against court exhibits where available.

All amounts are **(Unverified)** automated extractions. These are not audit findings — they are data observations. See [COMPLIANCE.md](../docs/COMPLIANCE.md) for the professional standards framework governing this analysis.

## Published Narratives

### 🔺 Original Finding

| # | Title | Key Finding | Data Scope |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|
| 17 | [One-Way Money](17_the_architecture.md) | The banks documented every dollar going in and almost none of it coming out. $272M entered nine shells across eight banking institutions. $63M is visible leaving. The other $209M has no documented exit in any production from any institution. | 382 wires · 158 entities · 8 banks · $558M |

This is the first complete balance sheet ever run on the Epstein shell network — not institution by institution, but across the full multi-bank production. Nobody else has published one.

## How to Read These

Each narrative follows the same structure:

- **Summary** — what I found, in plain language
- **The Data** — tables, counts, and measurements drawn from the source material
- **What the Pattern Shows** — the story the data tells
- **What I Cannot Determine** — the limits of what this analysis can prove

The first six narratives trace wire transfer patterns through Epstein's shell network. Narratives 7–10 expand the aperture: flight correlations, entity co-occurrence across 11.4 million records, full-corpus person scans, and forensic accounting tests. The methodology scales with the questions.

The source workbook containing all exhibits referenced in these narratives is available here: **<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11lw0QjMZ-rYIjWesv5VG1YKts57ahPEm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103970896670138914877&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Forensic Workbook (Google Sheets)</a>** (view-only).

I report what the data shows. Interpretation of intent, legality, or business purpose is left to qualified investigators, regulators, and readers.
