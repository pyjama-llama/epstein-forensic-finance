# Data Narratives

**The financial data tells stories that numbers alone cannot convey.**

These narratives trace specific fund flow patterns, entity relationships, and temporal correlations identified in the [master wire ledger](../data/master_wire_ledger_phase25.json). Each narrative is grounded in wire-level data extracted through the [25-phase pipeline](../METHODOLOGY.md) and cross-referenced against court exhibits where available.

All amounts are **(Unverified)** automated extractions. These are not audit findings — they are data observations. See [COMPLIANCE.md](../COMPLIANCE.md) for the professional standards framework governing this analysis.

## How to Read These

Each narrative follows the same structure:

- **Summary** — what I found, in plain language
- **The Data** — wire-by-wire tables with dates, amounts, entities, and source references
- **What the Pattern Shows** — the story the money tells
- **What I Cannot Determine** — the limits of what wire data can prove

I report what the data shows. Interpretation of intent, legality, or business purpose is left to qualified investigators, regulators, and readers.
