# Narrative 16: The Accountant

**Richard Kahn's CPA practice, HBRK Associates, routed 18,833 emails across the Epstein financial network. It touched every shell. It connected every person. It appears on more documents than any entity except the core hubs. And it was an accounting firm.**

---

## 11,153 Files

Richard Kahn appears on **11,153 documents** in the EFTA corpus. That is more than Southern Trust Company (883), Southern Financial (628), Financial Trust Company (1,014), and Gratitude America (209) combined.

7,103 of those files carry the attribution "Richard Kahn / HBRK Associates Inc." — meaning the majority of Kahn's document footprint is explicitly linked to his accounting practice, not to a personal capacity.

HBRK Associates is not a bank. It is not a law firm. It is not a trust company. It is a **Certified Public Accountant practice** — and it appears on more documents than any financial entity in the Epstein network.

## The Email Hub

HBRK Associates' document type breakdown:

| Document Type | Files |
|--------------|-------|
| **Email** | **18,833** |
| Financial | 133 |
| Document | 108 |
| Letter | 91 |
| Court Filing | 20 |
| Fax | 15 |
| Flight Log | 11 |
| Subpoena | 7 |
| Phone Record | 2 |

97.8% of HBRK's document footprint is email. The firm was not primarily preparing tax returns or performing audits — it was the network's **communications backbone**. Every instruction, every transaction coordination, every operational decision that required written documentation appears to have been routed through or copied to HBRK Associates.

The 11 flight log co-occurrences mean HBRK appeared in contexts involving aviation — the same flight records that document travel to and from St. Thomas and other Epstein locations.

## Every Shell, Every Document Type

No other entity in the network has HBRK's reach. Our co-occurrence analysis shows HBRK touching every major shell entity, across multiple document types:

### Email Co-occurrence (Primary Channel)

| Shell Entity | Shared Email Files |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Southern Financial | 67 |
| Southern Trust | 48 |
| Southern Trust Company | 34 |
| Haze Trust | 15 |
| Butterfly Trust | 13 |
| Jeepers, Inc. | 12 |
| Jeepers Inc. | 11 |
| Gratitude America | 8 |
| Financial Trust Company | 7 |
| The Haze Trust | 7 |
| Gratitude America Ltd. | 5 |
| Epstein & Co. | (via fax) |
| Nautilus, Inc. | (via document) |

### Cross-Channel Presence

| Shell Entity | Document | Fax | Court Filing | Financial |
|-------------|----------|-----|-------------|-----------|
| Southern Financial | 7 | 8 | 3 | 4 |
| Southern Trust | 7 | 4 | 3 | — |
| Butterfly Trust | 8 | 3 | 3 | — |
| FINANCIAL TRUST / SOUTHERN TRUST | 3 | — | — | — |
| Financial Trust Company | — | 4 | 3 | — |
| Nautilus, Inc. | 4 | — | 3 | — |
| Gratitude America | 3 | — | — | — |
| Epstein & Co. | — | 5 | — | — |

HBRK Associates doesn't just appear in emails. It co-occurs with shell entities across court filings (where it appeared in legal proceedings alongside shells), fax communications (direct business correspondence), financial documents (where accounting work product meets shell activity), and general documents.

The combined totals: Southern Trust/Financial (**167 shared files**), Butterfly Trust (**27**), Haze Trust (**26**), Jeepers (**23**), Gratitude America (**22**), Financial Trust Company (**17**), Epstein & Co (**9**), Nautilus (**7**).

This is not a CPA practice that prepared annual tax returns for a client. This is a CPA practice that was embedded in the daily operational communications of a 14-entity, 8-bank, $1.964 billion financial network.

## The Inner Circle

The persons who appear most frequently on HBRK-associated documents constitute the operational core of the Epstein network:

| Person | Shared Files with HBRK |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Richard Kahn** | **11,153** |
| **Jeffrey Epstein** | **4,510** |
| Jeffrey E. [OCR variants] | 3,533 |
| Jeffrey [partial] | 2,610 |
| **Rich Kahn** | **1,441** |
| **Lesley Groff** | **1,280** |
| Richard [partial] | 1,191 |
| **Emad Hanna** | **894** |
| **Daphne Wallace** | **881** |
| **Bella Klein** | **819** |
| **Karyna Shuliak** | **587** |

The names are significant:

**Lesley Groff** (1,280 files) — Epstein's long-time personal assistant and scheduler. She was named in multiple victim lawsuits and described as a gatekeeper for Epstein's appointments. Her presence on 1,280 HBRK files means the accounting firm was in direct, frequent communication with Epstein's operational staff.

**Emad Hanna** (894 files) — Epstein employee involved in property and financial management.

**Daphne Wallace** (881 files) — Epstein's property manager for the New York residence and other locations.

**Bella Klein** (819 files) — Epstein assistant referenced in multiple depositions.

**Karyna Shuliak** (587 files) — Epstein's girlfriend at the time of his death. Her appearance on 587 HBRK files — more than many shell entities' total file counts — means the accounting firm's communications included Epstein's personal relationship.

This is not a client-accountant relationship with normal boundaries. The CPA practice was in the operational loop with Epstein's household staff, personal assistants, property managers, and girlfriend.

## The Professional Standards Question

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct establishes standards for CPA practices:

**ET § 1.400.001 — Acts Discreditable:** A member shall not commit an act discreditable to the profession. Knowingly facilitating financial structures designed to evade reporting requirements would constitute a discreditable act.

**ET § 1.300.001 — Accounting Principles:** A member shall not knowingly misrepresent facts or subordinate their judgment to the client.

**Independence Standards:** While HBRK was not performing attest services (audits), the level of operational integration documented here — 18,833 emails, daily coordination with staff, presence on flight logs — raises the question of whether the firm maintained the professional independence and objectivity that CPA practices are expected to exhibit.

A CPA practice that prepares tax returns for a client receives financial records, prepares returns, and corresponds periodically. A CPA practice that routes 18,833 emails across a 14-entity shell network, co-occurs on documents with the client's household staff and girlfriend, and appears on flight logs is performing a different function.

The EFTA documents don't tell us what HBRK knew about the network's purpose. They tell us the firm was at the center of it.

## The Money Was Modest

The financial documents where HBRK appears show relatively modest dollar amounts:

Top money values: $25,000 (15 mentions), $100,000 (11), $2,000,000 (10), $5,000,000 (9), $2,500,000 (9), $10,000 (9), $3,000 (12).

The recurring references to invoice numbers (826119 Invoice # on 69 mentions) suggest routine accounting billings. HBRK's own fees were likely small — the standard CPA fee structure for tax preparation and bookkeeping services.

This is the point: HBRK Associates was not a major financial beneficiary of the network. The money flowing through the shells — the $60.5 million from Leon Black, the $25 million from Rothschild, the $244 million through Southern Trust — dwarfs whatever HBRK earned in professional fees. The firm's significance is not in how much money it received. It's in how much money it **coordinated**.

An accounting firm earning modest fees but routing 18,833 emails across a network moving $1.964 billion. That is the disproportion that makes HBRK Associates the most structurally important entity that nobody has examined.

- "HBRK stands for Harry Beller Richard Kahn" — 2025 Bank of America and BNY Mellon class action lawsuits, SDNY
- Senate Finance Committee letter (Wyden et al., December 2025): Kahn had signatory authority over Epstein accounts at JPMC "and other financial institutions"
- JPMorgan SARs: "Kahn was a primary actor in movement of Epstein's funds" and "potentially assisted in facilitating the sex trafficking ring" (2023 JPMC internal KYC profile)
- Bella Klein confirmed as Kahn's assistant who communicated with trafficking victims about wire transfers (BofA class action)
- DOJ/FBI never questioned Kahn or Indyke in connection with any criminal investigation (Senate Finance Committee, December 2025)
- Bank of America lawsuit: Kahn "devised schemes to entrap" trafficking victims and "serviced the taxes of numerous Epstein victims"
